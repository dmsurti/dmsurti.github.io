      <description>Every time a new year dawns and people come up with resolutions. Though I am not the kind of person who can do it with resolutions. I cannot decide anything at the spur of a moment and go for it. I though must point out that I apply this constraint to professional matters ;-)
The problem I find with resolutions is that there is not sufficient thought thats gone behind it.</description>
