      <description>Often in every other project, we can hear the following whispers..at times they get too loud. Developers: We are not getting requirments right. Typically the expecatation is from requirement gatherers. Requirement gatherers: Customer is not able to give requirments clearly. Typically expectation is from customer. So the flow usually is from developers -&amp;gt; requirement gatherers -&amp;gt; customers. This happens on development projects.
You may note I have not mentioned business analysts/functional/domain experts.</description>
