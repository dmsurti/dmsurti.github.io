      <description>While reading how to read better and faster by Norman Lewis, I learnt a big lesson. Which I had learnt earlier also. But then its always good to revise. The difference between &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wish&amp;rdquo;. I realized that in many projects we say &amp;ldquo;wish we had automated tests, wish we had continous builds&amp;rdquo; etc. But we dont anything. Why? Because we dont really want to change or are &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo;ing to put the efforts and bear the pain of change.</description>

      <description>Of late I am back to getting skilled at my interest of reading. Reading is one of the best ways to keep one informed. And to keep yourself informed, you also need to read a variety of material. People I find who read a variety of material are those who have developed good reading habits.
To develop these habits for self, I picked what else but the Reading Manual by Norman Lewis.</description>
