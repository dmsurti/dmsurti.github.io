      <title>Hibernate Mappings &amp; Encapsulated Collections</title>

      <description>Collections must be encapsulated. Also I am using Hibernate as the persistence solution. I have a uni-directional many to many relationship between Parent and Child. My java code looks like this:
Parent { String name; Set children = new HashSet(); public void getChildren() { return Collections.unmodifiableCollection(children); } private void setChildren(Set children) { this.children = children; } public void addChild(Child obj) { ///..... } public void removeChild(Child obj) { ///.... } } Child { String name; //.</description>

      <title>Using Agile</title>

      <description>The past 3 yrs or so I have learnt a lot of lessons, most of which are &amp;ldquo;how to write better software&amp;rdquo;. &amp;hellip;
The challenge in front of me is to, at every given opportunity (with a change of perception I realize these are infinite) use agile practices.
Why do I want to use agile practices? Most importantly using agile practices makes my life less stressful and work infinte fun :-)</description>

      <description>I was asked to write this utility to convert a graph of objects of type &amp;lsquo;X&amp;rsquo; into type &amp;lsquo;Y&amp;rsquo;. The difference between X and Y is that X objects sit in a layer whereas Y travel all over the network.
I was already handed out some partly written code. I was happy because I am training myself to be an agile practitioner and reading, working on someone else&amp;rsquo;s code should be easy for me.</description>

      <description>In an earlier post I had pointed out use of TDD and Refactoring to write the domain logic for poll measurements.
Key activities still were to be done: - Persist this data onto database. - Create views to play with this data.
You may have guessed I believe in working demos. Not html prototypes. I want to see in code that I can do it atleast in 1 way what I or you claim to be possible.</description>

      <description>Often in every other project, we can hear the following whispers..at times they get too loud. Developers: We are not getting requirments right. Typically the expecatation is from requirement gatherers. Requirement gatherers: Customer is not able to give requirments clearly. Typically expectation is from customer. So the flow usually is from developers -&amp;gt; requirement gatherers -&amp;gt; customers. This happens on development projects.
You may note I have not mentioned business analysts/functional/domain experts.</description>

      <description>Reading a Newspaper Reading a Comprehension Piece Reading a Book Details Awareness  Here&amp;rsquo;s a sample of how I read. Basically how I approach. Please note that these are only general tips and you will need to make changes as per your requirments.
Reading a Newspaper The articles of interest for me are typically columns, edits and analysis types. (You may see I have an Indian Express hangover :-).</description>

      <title>Java Access Specifiers</title>

      <guid>https://www.deepaksurti.com/java-access-specifiers/</guid>
      <description>So many times there is confusion about java and its access specifers. Here’s what they mean once and for all.
Public: Available to all wherever you may be.
Private: Available only to me.
Protected: Available to my derived types.
Friend: Available to all who belong to my group (package) i.e. are my friends.
Naturally, if I make a class private it can’t be accessed by anyone except the class itself! Now trying make a class protected.</description>

      <description>Take a look.
I had this requirment:
We conduct polls (which can be looked at like permanent polls). We gather monthly statistics. We want to : - find out votes cast till a month say Jun 2005 - find out votes cast for a quarter of a finanical year say Quarter 1 for 2004 - 2005 - find out votes cast for a half yearly of a financial year say half year 1 for 2004 - 2005 - find out votes cast for a fin year say 2004 - 2005.</description>

      <title>No New Year Resolutions</title>

      <description>Every time a new year dawns and people come up with resolutions. Though I am not the kind of person who can do it with resolutions. I cannot decide anything at the spur of a moment and go for it. I though must point out that I apply this constraint to professional matters ;-)
The problem I find with resolutions is that there is not sufficient thought thats gone behind it.</description>

      <title>Learning Tips</title>
      <link>https://www.deepaksurti.com/learning-tips/</link>

      <description>Learning I believe never stops. Only the rate of learning. If you are conscious about your learning, great. But the biggest change comes about when people get into jobs. Somehow there is the impression, once again from the mechanical industry, that your learning, education is where you spend time learning. And the fruit of that is a job where you are not supposed to learn.
But the knowledge industry has changed that.</description>

      <title>IIM Cat 2004</title>

      <guid>https://www.deepaksurti.com/iim-cat-2004/</guid>
      <description>Why the big fuss? That questions carry unequal marks, we dont know the proportion of negative marks etc. CAT = Certainly Abnormal Test. CAT 2004 for sure made everyone realize what to expect &amp;ldquo;Dont expect&amp;rdquo; ;-)
Anyways a huge change was anticipated. How short our memories are? CAT 2003 was held again in Feb 2004 because some Don played Cat and Mouse with the IIMs reputation. So the lion had to roar back.</description>

      <title>Personality Types Xp</title>

      <description>I was going through a chapter of Norman Lewis Reading Faster. Here he talks about personality types and their reading habits. And immediately I started to think if there is a link between personality types and XP. Because what is XP but a set of habits that people on the Xp project have. Habit of writing tests first, habit of automating tests, habit of domain design, habit of integrating continuously. Habits and more habits.</description>

      <description>The other day I was reading Andrew S Grooves &amp;ldquo;Only the Paranoid Survive&amp;rdquo;. This book basically talks about those points one faces in career or buisiness ( I know nothing there) which do a volte-face. Everything that seemed so right till yesterday has changed completely.
Andrew talks about PC and Internet, the two inflection points which have impacted both careers and business in a profound way. And he also says that to handle these crisis points or strategic inflection points, one needs always to be on the alert and keep experimenting.</description>

      <description>While reading how to read better and faster by Norman Lewis, I learnt a big lesson. Which I had learnt earlier also. But then its always good to revise. The difference between &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;wish&amp;rdquo;. I realized that in many projects we say &amp;ldquo;wish we had automated tests, wish we had continous builds&amp;rdquo; etc. But we dont anything. Why? Because we dont really want to change or are &amp;ldquo;will&amp;rdquo;ing to put the efforts and bear the pain of change.</description>

      <description>Of late I am back to getting skilled at my interest of reading. Reading is one of the best ways to keep one informed. And to keep yourself informed, you also need to read a variety of material. People I find who read a variety of material are those who have developed good reading habits.
To develop these habits for self, I picked what else but the Reading Manual by Norman Lewis.</description>
